From the product page, you can:

* Add the desired amount of products to your cart.

If a product has variations, they are displayed in a separate widget as a list or as a table:

![Products variations](../media/product-variations.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" width="750"}

Click **Filters** to narrow down the selection of variations:

![Variations filter](../media/variations-filter.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" width="750"}

If a [reviews option is enabled](/platform/user-guide/latest/rating-reviews/managing-reviews#enable-product-reviews) for the Frontend Application, the reviews are displayed below the product description:

![Product reviews](../media/reviews-on-frontend.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }
