# Personal and Corporate Accounts

Our Frontend supports two different account categories: personal and corporate.

A personal account allows individuals to shop in their personal capacity. Conversely, a corporate account allows you to shop on behalf of a company, eliminating the need to provide personal addresses and instead using those associated with the company. Corporate account users can switch between multiple organizations:

![Multiple organizations](../media/storefront-multiple-organizations.png)

As a result, the menu for corporate accounts does not include an **Address** item, but rather an entire section dedicated to corporate information:

![accounts](../media/personal-corporate-accounts.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }
