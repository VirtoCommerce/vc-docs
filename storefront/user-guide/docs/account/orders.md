# Orders

The **Orders** section lists all the user's orders, including order number, invoice number, order date, current status, and total order amount.

* Filter orders by status, date of creation, and date range.

    !!! note 
        In the left menu, you can immediately see all orders sorted by status, without having to apply any filters.
