# Purchase Requests

If employees need approval before making a purchase, they can create a purchase request. This is done from the **Purchase requests** section in their personal account. To start, upload a printed or handwritten file with the items to be purchased and click **Proceed to quote**:

Next, [complete and submit the quote](quote-requests.md#complete-and-submit-quote-request), then [decline or approve the received proposal](quote-requests.md#approve-or-decline-quote-request).

Once submitted, purchase requests become quotes and can be viewed and managed in the **Quote requests** section. Draft purchase requests that haven't been submitted yet remain in the **Purchase requests** section, where they can be reviewed and edited as needed:
