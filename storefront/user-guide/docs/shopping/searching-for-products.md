# Search Options

Within the Frontend Application, there are two ways to search for products:

* **Keyword search**: Use the search box to find products based on keywords, SKU numbers, or other product attributes.
* **Faceted search**: Use facets to further refine your search results.

For example, when searching for books, you can narrow your selection by author, course, or price. For additional precision, you can filter results based on product availability, indicated by the **Show in stock** checkbox. Search results can be sorted:

* Alphabetically.
* By price.
* By date.
