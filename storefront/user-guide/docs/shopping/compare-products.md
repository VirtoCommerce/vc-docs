# Compare Products

To make informed purchasing decisions, you can directly compare multiple products or items side by side. Customers can select multiple products they are interested in and see a detailed, side-by-side comparison of their specifications, features, and attributes. 

To add a product to the compare list:

1. Click ![balances](../media/balances.png){: width="20"} in the top right corner of the product card. The notification of successful addition to the compare list appears.

    !!! Note
        Only 5 products can be compared at a time.

1. Click **Compare** in the popup notification or in the top menu to open the compare list.
