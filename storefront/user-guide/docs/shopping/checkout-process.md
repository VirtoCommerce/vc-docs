1. Click **Proceed to checkout**.

    !!! note
        The checkout process for carts containing only digital products does not include the **Shipping** step since digital products do not require shipping.

    === "Pickup"

        Select a pickup point from the list if you do not require delivery and provide your comments, if any.

        * Select a shipping address if you need you order to be delivered to your address.

            !!! note
                If [Shipping address policy](../../../../platform/user-guide/store/settings#general-settings) is enabled in the Platform, you will see a prefilled shipping address on the Shipping page.

        * Select a delivery method from the dropdown list: **Ground** or **Air**. The shipping cost appears in the order summary.
        * Enter your comments, if any.

1. Click **Proceed to billing** to proceed to the next step.

1. Specify payment details:
    * Select a shipping address from the list, add new one, or check **Same as shipping address**. 
    * Select a payment method from the dropdown list:

        === "Bank card (Authorize.Net)"
        
            **Authorize.net** adds the **Payment** step to the checkout process. It does not appear if you choose to pay manually.

        === "Bank card (Skyflow)" 
        
            **SkyFlow** adds the **Payment** step to the checkout process. It does not appear if you choose to pay manually. It allows you to save credit cards for further payments and select previously saved cards from the dropdown list.

        === "Bank card (CyberSource)"

            **CyberSource**  adds the **Payment** step to the checkout process. It does not appear if you choose to pay manually. It allows you to save credit cards for further payments and select previously saved cards from the dropdown list.

        === "Manual"
        
            **Manual payment** allows you to pay for the order later.
