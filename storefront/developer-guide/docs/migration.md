# Migration

Current Storefront and Theme users can migrate to the new storefrontless architecture [with our assistance](https://help.virtocommerce.com/support/home), or continue using the Storefront with the [1.62 version](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-theme-b2b-vue/tree/support/1.62), which will receive updates until the end of 2024. After that, while it will still be possible to use the Storefront, no further updates will be provided.

A step-by-step guide for migrating to a storefrontless architecture without our assistance will be available soon.
