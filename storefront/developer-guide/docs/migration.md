# Migration

Current Storefront and Theme users have the following options:

* Migrate to the new storefrontless architecture:
    * Using our [guide for migration on Azure Cloud.](migration-on-azure.md) 
    * Using our [guide for migration on a local machine.](migration-on-local-machine.md)
    * [With our assistance.](https://help.virtocommerce.com/support/home)
* Continue using the Storefront with the [1.62 version](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-theme-b2b-vue/tree/support/1.62), which will receive updates until the end of 2024. After that, while it will still be possible to use the Storefront, no further updates will be provided.
