# Overview

Virto Commerce Frontend is designed to be flexible and extensible. As a developer, you can adapt it to the needs of your e-commerce project in two complementary ways:

* [Customization of the application itself](customization-overview.md): Modify the **appearance** and **functionality** that define the customer experience (icons, images, SCSS/CSS styles, theme presets, menus, product display settings, and other runtime configurations.)
* [Using development accelerators](accelerators-overview.md): Use built-in tools and scripts that automate routine tasks, enforce consistency, and make the customization process faster and safer (GraphQL type generation, locale checks and fixes, bundle analysis, dependency validation, SSL certificate generation).
