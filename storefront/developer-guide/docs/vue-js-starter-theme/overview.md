## Technologies and Frameworks Used

- **[Vue3](https://vuejs.org/):** Progressive frontend framework with its key features allowing one to build fast applications.
    
- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**:** All components and composables have type definitions, so that IDE could help you build clean and working code.
    
- [**TailwindCSS**](https://tailwindcss.com)**:** The most popular and growing CSS framework providing wonderful flexible structure to speed up styling.
    
- **Husky + ESLint + Prettier:** Autoformat, check, and fix your code and prevent ugly code style within repository.
    
- [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev/)**:** Faster than Webpack, it is used to develop code with HMR benefits and build for production.
    
- [**GraphQL**](https://graphql.org/) **:** Use flexible GraphQL queries and mutations to safely work with back end.

## Key Non-functional Capabilities

- **Development performance:** Thanks to maximum reusing of exciting developer experience, such as server side functionality, web components and views, and ready made theme architecture, the risk of wrong design decisions for new projects is drastically reduced.
    
- **Client performance:** We are supposed to reach and hold green metrics provided by Google PageSpeed Insights.
    
- **Decoupled structure:** Presentation layer is decoupled from back end. Shared logic is decoupled from visual components. As a developer, you can concentrate on a single task without the need of massive code manipulations.
    
- [**Atomic Design Pattern**](https://virtocommerce.com/atomic-architecture)**:** Theme UI is based on atoms, molecules, and organisms, combined within pages and shared components. This provides a high level of code reusability.
    
- **Simple styling and theme customization:** We use TailwindCSS to provide the easiest and most convenient way of CSS usage. Write as less code as possible and reuse the existing highly customizable framework features.
    
- **Fully aligned with Virto Commerce platform:** This theme is just a visual representation, we are fully aligned with the platform to provide all common B2B and B2C scenarios Virto Commerce platform provides.
    
- **Fully responsive:** We made our theme work on a number of devices, including desktop and mobile, being focused both on UI and UX.
    
- Ultimate **starting point** for all new themes
    
- **SEO friendly** thanks to **SSR** (Server Side Rendering) running on the VC Storefront [ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core and Liquid pages.
