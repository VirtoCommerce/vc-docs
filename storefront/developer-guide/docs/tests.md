# Tests

For Frontend testing purposes, we use the Virto Commerce [Testing module](../../../platform/developer-guide/Fundamentals/Testing/testing). It is a dedicated test automation framework that ensures the quality, stability, and correctness of the Virto Commerce Frontend application.

The module helps validate critical Frontend workflows, Frontend GraphQL interactions, and complete user journeys from product browsing to checkout and order placement. It enables reliable regression testing before releases and supports continuous verification in CI/CD pipelines.

The repository contains almost 80 automated tests focused on Frontend validation:

* 54 GraphQL functional tests verifying frontend GraphQL operations and business logic.
* 25 End-to-End (E2E) UI tests covering full user journeys in a real browser.
* Configurable test scenarios for different frontend configurations.
