# Builder.io Integration

Builder.io is a headless CMS that provides a visual editor for creating and managing content. The integration with Builder.io allows you to create and manage content in Builder.io and display it in the Virto Commerce Frontend Application. The integration is achieved through the use of the Builder.io API, which allows you to fetch content from Builder.io and display it in the **vue-b2b-theme**. The integration also provides a way to manage content in Builder.io and update it in the **vue-b2b-theme**. 

As long as Virto Frontend Application has native integration with Builder.io, you can start using it right away.
