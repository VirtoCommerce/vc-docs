# Overview

The Vendor Portal brings a set of tools to complete all Marketplace related tasks for a vendor. Here a vendor will be able to upload catalog, manage offers (prices and inventory), process orders and much more. It is designed to properly resize on the smaller screens so that a vendor would be able to complete his tasks on mobile devices without having to search for the desktop size screen. So the marketplace will always be in the hands of a vendor.

Open the Vendor Portal homepage to see its structure and main features:
