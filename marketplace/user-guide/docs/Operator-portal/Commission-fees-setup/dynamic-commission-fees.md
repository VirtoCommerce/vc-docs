# Dynamic Commission Fees

With the dynamic commission fees feature, you can assign a commission fee that overrides a static commission. The dynamic commissions can be applied to:

* Vendors.
* User groups.
* Products. 
* Product categories. 

It is common to use dynamic when there is a need to override static commissions for a particular products category or a specific product.
