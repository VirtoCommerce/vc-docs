# Overview

Commission structures are a fundamental component that determines how the marketplace operators earn revenue from the transactions. In Virto Commerce Marketplace, the commission fees feature allows a marketplace owner to flexibly setup commissions to be deducted from each transaction or transaction item for the benefit of the marketplace. 

The commissions can be assigned to:

* Vendor.
* Vendor group. 
* Product or products sets.
* Category or a set of categories.

In Virto Commerce Marketplace, you can setup:

* [Static commission fees](static-commission-fees.md), which are fixed-rate fees applied to transactions irrespective of any varying factors. 
* [Dynamic commission fees](dynamic-commission-fees.md), which are variable rates that can apply to product, product category, or a vendor.
