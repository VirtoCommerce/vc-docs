# Operator Orders

The Operator orders section in the main menu displays all the orders as they are submitted by customers via the storefront. In the Operator orders section, you can:

* [View submitted orders.](operator-orders.md#view-orders)
* [Manage submitted orders.](operator-orders.md#manage-orders)

## View orders 

A common scenario is as follows:

1. A customer buys products in the storefront. There can be products from various vendors in one order:

    ![Customer order](media/storefront-order.png)

1. The operator sees the newly placed order in the Operator orders section:

    ![Operator order](media/operator-portal-order.png)

1. The order automatically is split between vendors. Each vendor sees only their part of the order in the Vendor portal:

    === "Vendor 1"
        ![Order as seen by Vendor 1](media/order-vendor1.png)
    
    === "Vendor 2"
        ![Order as seen by Vendor 2](media/order-vendor2.png)
