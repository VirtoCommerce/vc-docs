# Master Catalog

The Master catalog serves as the central repository for all products listed in the marketplace. It includes products from all vendors. This ensures a unified and standardized product database. The Marketplace Operator portal allows you to set up a master catalog taxonomy. That is, configure a structure of catalog categories and a set of properties that can be configured for each category. Operators can create and manage product categories and subcategories within the Master catalog. This structure groups products in a logical, easy-to-navigate arrangement. Operators review products submitted by vendors. They approve the products before they appear in the Master catalog.

Let's explore a standard scenario and:

* [Add new category to the master catalog.](master-catalog.md#add-new-category)
* [Adding properties to the newly created category.](master-catalog.md#add-new-category)
