# Registration Requests

If a vendor wants to register on the marketplace, they can fill out a registration form that opens up to unregistered users:

![Registration form](media/registration-form.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }

After the vendor submits the form, the Operator sees it in the **Registration requests** section of the Operator portal with the **Pending** status:

![Registration request](media/registration-request.png)

!!! note
    An operator can fill out the form on behalf of a vendor by clicking **New request** in the toolbar.

The Operator can:

* **Process** the registration if additional steps are required. It receives **Processing** status in the list of registration requests.
* **Decline** the registration if it does not meet the necessary criteria. It receives **Declined** status in the list of registration requests.
* **Complete** the registration if no additional information is required. This will open the following form, which will be pre-filled with the information provided by the vendor:

    ![Send invitation](media/invite-new-vendor.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }

    Complete the form and click invite to send the invitation to the Vendor. The registration requests receives the **Completed** status.
    
    !!! note
        The statuses can be edited in the [State machines](state-machines.md) section.
    
     A new Vendor entity will be added to the list of vendors. The Vendor will receive an account activation link at the submitted email address. Once the account is activated, the owner can start using the Vendor portal and work with the Marketplace. 

!!! note
    After successful registration of a new vendor, operator can open their vendor portal directly from the registration form:

    ![Open vendor](media/open-vendor-from-registration-form.gif)

    Operators can open Vendor portal on behalf of a vendor [from the Vendors section](Vendors-management/vendor-management.md#log-in-to-vendor-portal-on-vendor-behalf).
