It must contain only your extended fields and the <code>Discriminator</code> field \u2014 nothing else.

The main Virto Commerce Indexed Search concepts are: </p> <ul> <li> <p>Search index: A logical group (container) that contains all documents (rows) of a single document (type). Each document also has fields (columns). Typically, it is mapped to a specific index within the index provider, such as the Elasticsearch index. In Virto there are the following indexes by default:</p> <ul> <li>Member: Searches for customer data.</li> <li>ContentFile: Searches for files or documents associated with content management.</li> <li>Product: Searches for catalog item .</li> <li>Category: Searches for catalog category.</li> <li>CustomerOrder: Searches for order.</li> </ul> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Index document: A single unit of searchable data in your index. There can be one document for each product in the catalog. Mapping these concepts to more familiar database equivalents, we can say that a search index is equivalent to a table, while documents are roughly equivalent to rows in the table. The document structure is determined by the index schema. Fields are typically the largest part of an index, where each field is named, assigned a value type, and attributed with allowable behaviors that determine how it is used.</p> <p></p> <p>The index document can look as follows:</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Indexing: A process for data indexing that extracts searchable content from various data sources and populates a search index within the specific search provider with instances of  index documents created from the source data by index document builders.</p> </li> <li> <p>Search query: A string consisting of keywords and terms that is processed by custom query syntax parser, which transforms it to a common search request. In other words, it is a complete specification of what should be returned as a result, for example:</p> <pre><code>`Asus color:Black,Blue price.usd:[100 TO 200)`\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Search: Enables performing search tasks with the indexed data, receives the search phrase in a special query language and interprets the string into a Virto common search request object that can be supplied to a specific search engine through the integration connector. The key search features include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Full text search with extensions for fuzzy search, proximity search, term boosting, and regular expressions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Faceted navigation and filters that allow users to navigate through a website by applying filters for categories, attributes, price ranges, and so on. This can be used to incorporate faceted navigation into your application's UI, enhance query formulation, and filter based on user or developer-specified criteria. </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Integration: Middleware providing integration to a specific search engine that enables mapping for objects of internal intermediated types, index documents and search requests, into the respective document and query objects a particular search engine expects to receive.     </p> </li> <li> <p>Search engine: A specific index search engine that handles all indexing and search requests. Virto has ready-made integrations with the following services:</p> <ul> <li>Elasticsearch 9: Version compatible with Elasticsearch 9.x, providing high-performance full-text search and advanced indexing capabilities for enterprise-scale deployments.</li> <li>Elasticsearch 8: Version compatible with Elasticsearch 8.x.

After that, when the reidnexing process starts, a new backup index is created with the `backup' alias. However, an actual index name is created dynamically: this is a special alphanumeric token suffix added to the end of the index name. The only way to tell which index is active is to look at its alias. After the indexing process is complete, the active and backup indices swap aliases, i.e. the active index becomes the backup index, and vice versa.</p> <p></p> <p> </p> \u2190 Indexing in Platform manager Search overview \u2192"},{"location":"Fundamentals/Indexed-Search/indexing/indexing-in-platform-manager/","title":"Indexing via Platform Manager","text":"<p>To initiate the indexing process:</p> <ol> <li>Click Search Index in the main menu.</li> <li> <p>The next blade displays:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The managed record types:</p> <ul> <li>Members: Users or entities that have access to the platform.</li> <li>Content files: Any type of digital content stored within the platform.</li> <li>Product: The goods or services offered for sale within the Virto Commerce platform.</li> <li>Category: Similar characteristics used to organize and classify products within the platform.</li> <li>Customer order: Transactions where customers purchase products or services from the platform.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The search provider for each record type:</p> <ul> <li>Elastic App Search.</li> <li>Elasticsearch 8.</li> <li>Lucene.</li> <li>Elasticsearch.</li> <li>Azure Cognitive Search.</li> <li>Algolia.</li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>You can tailor the search provider per document type to optimize search performance and functionality.</p> </li> <li> <p>Last indexed date, record count, and scope if specified by the user:</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Check the required record types from the list.</p> </li> <li>Click Build index in the top toolbar.</li> <li> <p>In the popup window, choose how you want to update the search index.

Optional dependencies enable developers to tailor solutions by adding or omitting modules as needed. </li> <li>Modular system architecture: Virto Commerce employs a modular architecture where different modules interact to deliver comprehensive functionalities. Optional dependencies facilitate a modular approach by defining relationships between modules, ensuring that the system remains flexible and scalable. </li> <li>Resource optimization: In resource-constrained environments, installing unnecessary modules can lead to inefficient resource allocation. Optional dependencies allow for resource optimization by enabling administrators to install only the essential modules required for desired functionalities. </li> <li>Feature expansion: As new features and capabilities are added to Virto Commerce, optional dependencies offer a way to integrate these features seamlessly without imposing unnecessary dependencies on existing modules. </li> <li>Selective module installation: Administrators may prefer to install a core set of modules initially and then add additional functionalities as needed. Optional dependencies empower administrators to manage module installations efficiently. </li> </ul> <p>For example, you can now install Catalog module without Export or BulkActionsModule if they are not required for your deployment.  </p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Fundamentals/Modularity/optional-dependency/#add-optional-dependency","title":"Add optional dependency","text":"<p>In this guide, we will configure a module within Virto Commerce Platform to have optional dependencies.

However, in scaled-out multiple instances applications, ensuring cache consistency becomes challenging.</p> <p>While distributed cache could address this challenge, it introduces network latency and requires serialization/deserialization support for all cached data, which can be complex to achieve. Instead, Virto Commerce utilizes a local cache storage approach for each application instance connected to a shared broadcasted service (backplane), receiving invalidation messages.</p> <p>To address this, a service is needed to which all application instances connect, broadcasting messages when cache data becomes invalid. Redis, an in-memory key-value store supporting a publish/subscribe model, is well-suited for this task. The Virto memory caching Redis backplane employs the pub/sub feature to forward messages to other servers.</p> <p>When a Platform instance evicts data from its cache, a message for this event is sent to the backplane, which then distributes it to all connected clients via their respective servers.

This means you cannot simply add any additional properties to the existing domain types without direct code modification. In order  to fix this, you can extend an entity class and add properties to the subclass.</p> <p>Let\u2019s see how the domain model extension works by extending the <code>CustomerOrder</code> type defined in the Order Module, with new properties.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>This approach does not work when a single domain entity type is to be extended from multiple modules. The extension domain model is based on class inheritance. Meanwhile, .NET does not support multiple class inheritance, so, as a result, only the last registered extension wins.</p> <p>Our first step is to define a new subclass, <code>CustomerOrder2</code>, derived from the original <code>CustomerOrder</code> class.</p> VirtoCommerce.OrdersModule2.Web/Model/CustomerOrder2.cs<pre><code>    public class CustomerOrder2 : CustomerOrder\n    {\n        public CustomerOrder2()\n        {\n            Invoices = new List&lt;Invoice&gt;();\n        }\n        public string NewField { get; set; }\n        public ICollection&lt;Invoice&gt; Invoices { get; set; }\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Now, we need to register the newly defined <code>CustomerOrder2</code> type in <code>AbstractFactory&lt;&gt;</code> to tell the system that <code>CustomerOrder2</code> is now overriding (replacing) the original <code>CustomerOrder</code> class and will be used everywhere instead of it.</p> VirtoCommerce.OrdersModule2.Web/Module.cs<pre><code>    public class Module : IModule\n    {\n        public void PostInitialize(IApplicationBuilder appBuilder)\n        {\n            ...\n             AbstractTypeFactory&lt;CustomerOrder&gt;.OverrideType&lt;CustomerOrder, CustomerOrder2&gt;()\n                                            .WithFactory(() =&gt; new CustomerOrder2 { OperationType = \"CustomerOrder\" }); //need to preserve original order  discriminator value\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Info</p> <p><code>AbstractTypeFactory&lt;&gt;</code> is the key element of Virto's extension concept that is responsible for activating a particular type of instance based on the internal type mapping table.</p> <p>Each piece of code that should support domain type extensions must use <code>AbstractTypeFactory&lt;BaseType&gt;.TryCreateInstance()</code> instead of the <code>new BaseType()</code> statement.</p> <p>When you need to override any base type with another derived type, you must call   <code>AbstractTypeFactory&lt;BaseType&gt;.OverrideType&lt;BaseType, DerivedType&gt;()</code>; each  call of  <code>AbstractTypeFactory&lt; BaseType&gt;.TryCreateInstance()</code> will return your <code>DerivedType</code> object instance instead of <code>BaseType</code>.</p> <p>This is how the type extension magic works.</p>"},{"location":"Tutorials-and-How-tos/Tutorials/extending-domain-models/#persistent-layer-extension-schema","title":"Persistent layer extension schema","text":"<p>We just extended the existing <code>CustomerOrder</code> class with a new <code>CustomerOrder2</code> class housing new  properties. The questions now is: how can you actually change the current DB schema and persist these new types into the database through Entity Framework (EF) Core? To solve this task, we can also use the inheritance techniques and define and derive new <code>Order2DbContext</code> from original <code>OrderDbContext</code>, along with <code>OrderRepository2</code> derived from <code>OrderRepository</code>.</p> VirtoCommerce.OrdersModule2.Web/Repositories/Order2DbContext.cs<pre><code>    //Derive custom DB context from the OrderDbContext\n    public class Order2DbContext : OrderDbContext\n    {\n         public Order2DbContext(DbContextOptions&lt;Order2DbContext&gt; builderOptions) : base(builderOptions)\n        {\n        }\n         protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\n        {\n            //the method code\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre> VirtoCommerce.OrdersModule2.Web/Repositories/OrderRepository2.cs<pre><code> public class OrderRepository2 : OrderRepository\n    {\n        public OrderRepository2(Order2DbContext dbContext, IUnitOfWork unitOfWork = null) : base(dbContext, unitOfWork)\n        {\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>In Virto, for persistence logic we use the Data Mapper pattern, which helps to completely isolate your domain from the persistence layer. Leveraging this pattern gives one more benefits with keeping domain contracts in a more stable state. It also enables changing the persistence schema without affecting the domain used for public contracts.</p> <p>Each domain type has its own representation in the database, namely dedicated <code>DataEntitity</code> classes that are defined in EF Core's <code>DbContext</code> through fluent syntax.Such classes have three methods:</p> <ul> <li><code>ToModel</code> and <code>FromModel</code>, which map domain type objects to persistent ones, and vice versa;</li> <li><code>Patch</code>, which applies changes to the specified columns only. This method is crucial for implementing partial update logic.</li> </ul> <p>Now let\u2019s define the new persistence <code>CustomerOrder2Entity</code> type that will represent the persistence schema model of the new <code>CustomerOrder2</code> class:</p> VirtoCommerce.OrdersModule2.Web/Model/CustomerOrder2Entity.cs<pre><code>    public class CustomerOrder2Entity : CustomerOrderEntity\n    {\n        public override OrderOperation ToModel(OrderOperation operation)\n        {\n           //the method code\n        }\n        public override OperationEntity FromModel(OrderOperation operation, PrimaryKeyResolvingMap pkMap)\n        {\n           //the method code\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>At the next stage, we need to generate new DB migration for our newly extended <code>Order2DbContext</code>. We can do that by running the following command within the Nuget package version console in Visual Studio:</p> <pre><code>Add-Migration InitialOrder2 -Context VirtoCommerce.OrdersModule2.Web.Repositories. Order2DbContext   -Verbose -OutputDir Migrations -Project VirtoCommerce.OrdersModule2.Web -StartupProject VirtoCommerce.OrdersModule2.Web -Debug\n</code></pre> <p>Running this command will yield the <code>Migrations/XXXXXX_InitialOrder2.cs</code> file containing the original (extendable) order module DB schema along with a new one. Thus, you will have to manually edit the resulting <code>InitialOrder2.cs</code> file leaving only those DB schema changes that are relevant to your extension. </p> VirtoCommerce.OrdersModule2.Web/Migrations/20200324130250_InitialOrders2.cs<pre><code>    public partial class InitialOrders2 : Migration\n    {\n        protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)\n        {\n           //the method code\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>Tip</p> <p>To avoid editing the resulting migration file, which may be time consuming and tricky, we recommend you first creating an empty initial migration file for the derived <code>DbContext</code> class with no changes. Then, you can just clean up the resulting  migration <code>.cs</code> file and leave the Up and Down methods empty. This will allow you to make changes to the custom 'derived' <code>DbContext</code> and generate a new migration file containing only your custom changes.</p> <p>Finally, the last step is to register our derived <code>OrderRepository2</code> and <code>Order2DbContext</code> in a DI container. By registering the new <code>OrderRepository2</code> in DI, we override the base <code>OrderRepository</code> defined in <code>CustomerOrder.Module</code>:</p> VirtoCommerce.OrdersModule2.Web/Module.cs<pre><code>    public class Module : IModule\n    {\n        public void Initialize(IServiceCollection serviceCollection)\n        {\n            var snapshot = serviceCollection.BuildServiceProvider();\n            var configuration = snapshot.GetService&lt;IConfiguration&gt;();\n            serviceCollection.AddDbContext&lt;Order2DbContext&gt;(options =&gt; options.UseSqlServer(configuration.GetConnectionString(\"VirtoCommerce\")));\n            serviceCollection.AddTransient&lt;IOrderRepository, OrderRepository2&gt;();\n\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre> <p>It is also important to register our new persistent schema representation, <code>CustomerOrder2Entity</code>, in <code>AbstractTypeFactory&lt;&gt;</code> and override the base <code>CustomerOrderEntity</code> with new type:</p> VirtoCommerce.OrdersModule2.Web/Module.cs<pre><code>    public class Module : IModule\n    {\n        public void PostInitialize(IApplicationBuilder appBuilder)\n        {\n            ...\n\n            AbstractTypeFactory&lt;IOperation&gt;.OverrideType&lt;CustomerOrder, CustomerOrder2&gt;();\n            AbstractTypeFactory&lt;CustomerOrderEntity&gt;.OverrideType&lt;CustomerOrderEntity, CustomerOrder2Entity&gt;();\n\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"Tutorials-and-How-tos/Tutorials/extending-domain-models/#how-api-understands-and-deserializes-derived-domain-types","title":"How API understands and deserializes derived domain types","text":"<p>Up to now, we talked about extending domain types and persistent layers.

This is concise for common cases.</li> <li>Objects: e.g., <code>:rules=\"{ required: true, min: 3 }\"</code>. This can be clearer for rules with parameters or when listing multiple rules. Parameters for rules are passed as the value (e.g., <code>{ min: 3 }</code>). For rules that are just flags (like <code>required</code>), <code>true</code> can be used as the value.</li> <li>Functions: For complex, field-specific logic not covered by global rules. These rules are either standard VeeValidate rules or custom ones globally defined. The <code>skuFormat</code> rule (used as a string in the example) must be globally registered or defined locally to work.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Local Reactive <code>formData</code>: <code>VcInput</code> and other form components are bound to this local state.</li> <li><code>@update:model-value</code> and <code>handleChange</code>: This synchronization mechanism remains crucial. When <code>formData</code> changes, <code>handleChange</code> informs VeeValidate.</li> <li>Flexibility with Rules: While string rules are common, you can still define complex validation logic as a function and pass it to the <code>rules</code> prop of a <code>Field</code> component if a specific field requires highly custom validation not covered by existing global rules.     <pre><code>// Example of a complex function rule for a specific field\n// const validateComplexField = (value) =&gt; {\n//   if (!value || value.length &lt; 10) return \"This field needs more complex criteria.\";\n//   // ... more logic\n//   return true;\n// };\n</code></pre>     And in the template:     <pre><code>// &lt;Field name=\"complexField\" :rules=\"validateComplexField\" ... /&gt;\n</code></pre></li> <li>Controlling UI State with <code>useModificationTracker</code>: While VeeValidate provides a <code>meta.dirty</code> flag, the <code>useModificationTracker</code> composable offers more robust deep-checking for complex objects and handles asynchronously loaded initial data more predictably.

make sense on larger screens. <code>render=\"always\"</code> (default) provides flexibility, rendering the sidebar appropriately for the current device context.</li> <li>Positioning: Choose <code>position=\"left\"</code> or <code>position=\"right\"</code> based on the content's purpose. Left is common for primary navigation, while right is often used for secondary information, filters, or actions.</li> <li>Clear title: If using the default header (by providing a <code>title</code> prop and not using the <code>header</code> slot), ensure the title is descriptive.</li> <li>Content overflow: The <code>sidebar__content</code> area is scrollable. Be mindful of the amount of content to ensure a good user experience, especially on smaller screens.</li> <li>State management: The <code>isExpanded</code> prop is crucial. Control this from the parent component, typically with a button that toggles its state. This state should accurately reflect whether the sidebar is intended to be visible.</li> <li>Closing mechanism: Ensure users can easily close the sidebar. The default close button (<code>closeCross</code> prop) and overlay click (on mobile) handle this. If providing a custom header via the <code>header</code> slot, make sure to implement a close mechanism and emit the <code>close</code> event.</li> <li>Teleport consideration: Understand that on mobile, the sidebar content is teleported to <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>.

It allows for rapid UI development by composing utility classes directly in your templates.</p> <p>The key principles for Tailwind CSS in VC-Shell are as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Embrace utility-first: Prioritize using Tailwind's utility classes (e.g., tw-text-lg, tw-p-4, tw-flex) directly in your Vue component templates.</li> <li>Prefixing: VC-Shell framework's Tailwind configuration uses the tw- prefix for all utility classes to avoid conflicts with other CSS or component library styles. Always use this prefix (e.g., class=\"tw-bg-primary-500 tw-text-white\").</li> <li>Configuration inheritance: Your application's Tailwind configuration should extend the base configuration provided by <code>@vc-shell/framework</code>. This ensures consistency with the framework's design system (colors, spacing, fonts, etc.) and allows you to easily customize or extend it. The theme values (like specific shades for primary-500) are typically defined as CSS custom properties (e.g., <code>var(--primary-500)</code>) in theme-specific blocks (<code>:root[data-theme=\"...\"]</code>). For framework-provided themes, these are in framework styles; for your custom themes or overrides, these definitions reside in your application's custom.scss file (or equivalent).</li> <li>Scoped styles for complex components: While utility classes are preferred, for very complex component-specific styles that are hard to achieve with utilities alone, use <code>&lt;style lang=\"scss\" scoped&gt;</code>. Within these scoped styles, you can still leverage Tailwind's theme values using the <code>@apply</code> directive (if needed, though direct utility usage is often cleaner) or CSS variables provided by the framework's theme (e.g., <code>var(--primary-500)</code>).</li> <li>Purging: Ensure your tailwind.config.ts is correctly configured to scan your project files (.vue, .ts, etc.) so that unused Tailwind classes are removed from the production build, keeping your CSS bundle size optimized.</li> </ul> <p>Example tailwind.config.ts (application level):</p> <p>Your application's tailwind.config.ts should look similar to this, extending the framework's default configuration:</p> <pre><code>// tailwind.config.ts\nimport type { Config } from \"tailwindcss\";\n// Import the default configuration and content paths from the VC-Shell framework\nimport defaultConfig, { content as frameworkContent } from \"@vc-shell/framework/tailwind.config\";\n\nconst config: Config = {\n  // Start with the framework's content paths and add your application-specific paths\n          content: [\n    ...frameworkContent, // Includes paths for framework components and UI elements\n    \"./src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}\", // Scan your app's source files\n    // Add paths to any other modules or packages that contain templates using Tailwind classes\n  ],\n  // Use the theme directly from the framework's default configuration.\n  // This includes colors, spacing, typography, etc., defined by VC-Shell.\n  theme: defaultConfig.theme, // Inherit the entire theme from the framework,\n  // Crucially, use the \"tw-\" prefix as defined in the framework's configuration.\n  // This is typically inherited if defaultConfig includes it, but explicitly stating it \n  // or ensuring it is part of defaultConfig is important.\n  prefix: defaultConfig.prefix || \"tw-\", // Ensures \"tw-\" prefix is used\n};\n\nexport default config;\n</code></pre> <p>Explanation:</p> <ul> <li><code>import defaultConfig, { content as frameworkContent } from \"@vc-shell/framework/tailwind.config\";</code>: This line is key. It imports the base Tailwind configuration and the default content paths from the VC-Shell framework.</li> <li><code>content</code>: You spread the <code>frameworkContent</code> and add your application-specific paths (like <code>./src/**/*.{vue,js,ts,jsx,tsx}</code>). This ensures Tailwind scans both framework components and your application components for used utility classes.</li> <li><code>theme</code>: By setting <code>theme: { ...defaultConfig.theme, ... }</code>, you inherit all the predefined spacing units, typography, etc., from the VC-Shell design system. </li> <li><code>prefix: defaultConfig.prefix || \"tw-\"</code>: This line ensures that your application's Tailwind build uses the same <code>tw-</code> prefix as the framework. This is vital for consistency and avoiding CSS class name collisions.</li> </ul> <p>Using tailwind classes in Vue components:</p> <pre><code>&lt;template&gt;\n  &lt;div class=\"tw-bg-neutral-100 tw-p-4 tw-rounded-lg tw-shadow\"&gt;\n    &lt;h3 class=\"tw-text-xl tw-font-semibold tw-text-primary-700\"&gt;\n      My Styled Card\n    &lt;/h3&gt;\n    &lt;p class=\"tw-mt-2 tw-text-neutral-600\"&gt;\n      This component uses Tailwind utility classes with the `tw-` prefix.\n    &lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;button\n      class=\"tw-mt-4 tw-px-4 tw-py-2 tw-bg-primary-500 tw-text-white tw-rounded\n             hover:tw-bg-primary-600 focus:tw-outline-none \n             focus:tw-ring-2 focus:tw-ring-primary-300\"\n    &gt;\n      Click me\n    &lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/template&gt;\n\n&lt;script lang=\"ts\" setup&gt;\n// Component logic\n&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&lt;!-- For more complex, component-specific styles --&gt;\n&lt;style lang=\"scss\" scoped&gt;\n.my-custom-element {\n  // You can still use CSS variables from the VC-Shell theme\n  border-left: 4px solid var(--primary-500);\n  background-color: var(--neutral-50); // Lighter neutral for background\n\n  &amp;:hover {\n    border-left-color: var(--primary-700);\n  }\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>By following this approach, your application will seamlessly integrate with VC-Shell's styling, benefit from a pre-configured design system, and maintain optimized CSS.</p>"},{"location":"custom-apps-development/vc-shell/Guides/application-architecture-best-practices/#managing-static-assets-public-directory","title":"Managing static assets (<code>public/</code> directory)","text":"<p>The public/ directory in the root of your VC-Shell application is used for static assets that don't go through the Vite build process directly but need to be available at predictable URLs or are referenced directly in your <code>index.html</code>.</p> <p>The public/ includes:</p> <ul> <li>index.html: While not strictly a static asset you add, index.html resides here and is the entry point for your SPA.

When navigating to a URL like <code>/main/details/123</code>, the blade navigation system's <code>routeResolver</code> will first match <code>/main</code> to open the main blade/workspace. Then, from the remaining path <code>details/123</code>, it will match <code>/details</code> (the <code>url</code> defined in the child blade's <code>defineOptions</code>) to open the child blade. The subsequent part of the URL (<code>123</code> in this example) will then be passed as the <code>param</code> prop to this child blade. Thus, dynamic parameters are extracted by <code>routeResolver</code> from the browser's URL and passed via <code>param</code>, not by defining patterns like <code>/:id</code> within <code>defineOptions.url</code> itself. -   Standard Props:     -   <code>expanded?: boolean</code>: Controls if the blade is initially expanded (defaults to <code>true</code>).     -   <code>closable?: boolean</code>: Controls if the blade shows a close button (defaults to <code>true</code>).     -   <code>param?: string</code>: A generic string parameter you can pass when opening the blade programmatically.     -   <code>options?: Record&lt;string, any&gt;</code>: For passing more complex, structured data when opening the blade. -   Standard Emits:     -   <code>close:blade</code>: Emitted when the blade's close button is clicked or when it should close itself.     -   <code>expand:blade</code>: Emitted when the blade is expanded.     -   <code>collapse:blade</code>: Emitted when the blade is collapsed.     -   <code>parent:call</code>: A crucial emit for communication with the blade that opened this one (if any). It sends an <code>IParentCallArgs</code> object (<code>{ method: string, args?: any }</code>) to instruct the parent. -   The <code>menuItem</code> object, if provided, allows the blade to be automatically added to the application's main navigation menu. See \"Building Navigation Menus with <code>useMenuService</code>\" for more on <code>menuItem</code> properties. -   Import and use UI components from <code>@vc-shell/framework</code> like <code>VcBlade</code>, <code>VcInput</code>, etc. -   Use <code>withDefaults</code> to provide default values for your props.</p>"},{"location":"custom-apps-development/vc-shell/Guides/developing-custom-modules/#3-creating-composables-for-business-logic","title":"3.

The exact import path and names will depend on your NSwag/OpenAPI configuration.</li> <li>Use <code>const { getApiClient } = useApiClient(YourSpecificApiClientConstructor);</code> to get a function that returns an initialized instance of your API client.</li> <li>In your data-fetching actions (like <code>fetchReviews</code>), call <code>await getApiClient()</code> to get the client instance, then call its methods (e.g., <code>client.searchReviews()</code>).</li> <li>Adapt the method names (<code>searchReviews</code>) and parameter/response structures to match what your actual API client provides. The example from <code>AssociationsItems.vue</code> uses <code>searchQuery.value</code> which is a <code>ref</code> holding search parameters.</li> <li>The <code>useAsync</code> composable from <code>@vc-shell/framework</code> is excellent for managing loading states and errors for asynchronous operations. It returns <code>action</code> (your async function), <code>loading</code> (a boolean ref), and <code>error</code> (a ref for any caught error).</li> <li>Keep API interaction logic within composables rather than directly in Vue components. This improves separation of concerns and testability.</li> <li>Define and export any reactive state (<code>ref</code>, <code>reactive</code>, <code>computed</code>) and methods that your Vue components will need to interact with the module's data and logic.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"custom-apps-development/vc-shell/Guides/developing-custom-modules/#4-adding-module-specific-components","title":"4.

Import all modules from your modules package/directory\n// This path will depend on how your modules are structured and exported.\n// For example, if you have a local modules directory or a scoped package:\nimport * as appModules from \"./modules\"; // Or, e.g., \"@my-org/feature-modules\"\n\n// ... other imports like locales, bootstrap functions, etc.\n\nconst app = createApp(App); // Or createApp(RouterView)\n\n// Initialize VirtoShellFramework first\n// Note: The `modules` array in FrameworkOptions is not used in this specific loading pattern.\n// Instead, modules are registered individually later.\napp.use(VirtoShellFramework, {\n  router, // Pass the router instance to the framework\n  i18n: {\n    locale: import.meta.env.APP_I18N_LOCALE, // Example i18n config\n    fallbackLocale: import.meta.env.APP_I18N_FALLBACK_LOCALE,\n  },\n  // ... other framework options\n});\n\n// 2. Register each application module\n// The exact structure to access the list of modules might vary.\n// In the example, modules are under a `default` export\n// from the `appModules` import, and each module itself is also under a `default` export.\nif (appModules.default) {\n  Object.values(appModules.default).forEach((moduleDefinition: any) =&gt; {\n    // Ensure you are accessing the correct module object that was returned by createAppModule.\n    // It might be moduleDefinition.default if each module file also uses `export default`.\n    const moduleToRegister = moduleDefinition.default || moduleDefinition;\n\n    // Pass any necessary options to the module during registration, e.g., the router instance.\n    app.use(moduleToRegister, { router });\n  });\n} else {\n  // Fallback or error handling if modules are not found as expected.\n  // This structure might also be different, e.g., if appModules itself is the array/object of modules:\n  // Object.values(appModules).forEach((moduleToRegister: any) =&gt; { ... });\n  console.warn(\"No modules found or modules are not structured as expected.\");\n}\n\napp.use(router); // Ensure router is used by the app\n\n// ... other app setup like bootstrap, global error handling, mounting ...\n\n// Example: bootstrap(app);\n// Example: app.mount(\"#app\");\n</code></pre></p> <p>Key aspects of this loading pattern:</p> <ul> <li>Centralized Module Import: Modules are often imported collectively (e.g., <code>import * as appModules from \"./modules\";</code> or a specific package name like <code>\"@my-org/feature-modules\"</code>).</li> <li>Iterative Registration: You iterate over the imported modules and register each one with <code>app.use()</code>.</li> <li>Accessing Module Definition: Pay attention to how the actual module object (the one returned by <code>createAppModule</code>) is accessed. If your module files use <code>export default createAppModule(...)</code>, and your collective import also wraps them (e.g., in another <code>default</code> object), you might need <code>module.default</code> or similar to get to the registrable module instance, as seen with <code>moduleDefinition.default || moduleDefinition</code> and <code>appModules.default</code> in the example.</li> <li>Passing Options to Modules: When calling <code>app.use(moduleToRegister, options)</code>, you can pass an options object to your module. The example shows passing <code>{ router }</code>. If your module's <code>setup</code> function (the one inside the object passed to <code>createAppModule</code>, if you were using that pattern, or a similar mechanism if <code>createAppModule</code> itself can accept options for its setup phase) is designed to receive options, this is where they would be provided.</li> </ul> <p>Important: The exact import paths and the way you access the list of modules (<code>appModules.default</code>, <code>Object.values(...)</code>, <code>moduleDefinition.default</code>) must be adapted to how your specific project and its modules are structured and exported.</p> <p>By registering your modules this way, their pages, routes, locales, and other assets become available to the application, integrated by the VC-Shell framework and Vue itself.</p>"},{"location":"custom-apps-development/vc-shell/Guides/developing-custom-modules/#module-specific-routing","title":"Module-Specific Routing","text":"<p>As shown in the <code>createAppModule</code> section, when you list your page components (blades) in the <code>pages</code> object, the framework automatically handles their route registration based on the <code>url</code> property within each page's <code>defineOptions</code>.</p> <p>How it Works:</p> <ol> <li><code>defineOptions</code> in Blades: Each blade component (e.g., <code>ReviewListBlade.vue</code>) uses <code>defineOptions</code> to declare its intended URL, unique name, and other metadata.     <pre><code>// Inside ReviewListBlade.vue\ndefineOptions({\n  name: \"ReviewListBlade\",\n  url: \"/reviews\",       // This becomes the path\n  // ... other options\n});\n</code></pre></li> <li><code>createAppModule</code>: When your module is processed via <code>createAppModule</code> and subsequently registered in <code>main.ts</code>, the framework iterates through the <code>pages</code> object.</li> <li>Route Generation: For each page, it generates a Vue Router route record.<ul> <li>The <code>path</code> of the route is taken from the <code>url</code> in <code>defineOptions</code>.</li> <li>The <code>name</code> of the route is typically derived from the <code>name</code> in <code>defineOptions</code> (e.g., \"ReviewListBlade\").</li> <li>The <code>component</code> for the route is the page component itself.</li> <li>Any <code>props: true</code> or similar routing options can also be inferred or configured if needed (though <code>defineOptions</code> primarily focuses on discoverability and menu integration).</li> <li>Permissions defined in <code>defineOptions</code> are used to automatically add navigation guards if the permissions plugin is active.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Example Route Registration (Conceptual):</p> <p>If <code>ReviewListBlade.vue</code> has <code>url: \"/reviews\"</code> and <code>ReviewEditBlade.vue</code> has <code>url: \"/review\"</code>, the framework will effectively add routes similar to this to the Vue Router configuration:</p> <pre><code>// Conceptual representation of routes added by the framework\nconst moduleRoutes = [\n  {\n    path: \"/reviews\",\n    name: \"ReviewListBlade\",\n    component: ReviewListBlade, // The imported .vue component\n    meta: { permissions: [\"reviews:view\"] } // Example if permissions are set\n  },\n  {\n    path: \"/review\",\n    name: \"ReviewEditBlade\",\n    component: ReviewEditBlade,\n    meta: { permissions: [\"reviews:edit\"] },\n  }\n];\n</code></pre> <p>Accessing Module Pages:</p> <p>Once registered, blade pages with a defined <code>url</code> become accessible via their URLs (e.g., <code>your-app.com/reviews</code> or <code>your-app.com/review</code>).

This is the place for initial data fetching or setup specific to the blade instance.     <pre><code>// Inside your blade's &lt;script setup lang=\"ts\"&gt;\nimport { onMounted } from 'vue';\n\nonMounted(() =&gt; {\n  console.log('Blade has been mounted (opened).');\n  // Fetch initial data, set up listeners, etc.\n});\n</code></pre></li> <li>For the Caller: When you open a blade using <code>useBladeNavigation().openBlade()</code>, you can provide an <code>onOpen</code> callback in the <code>navigation</code> options.

This is where you should clean up event listeners, timers, or any other resources.     <pre><code>// Inside your blade's &lt;script setup lang=\"ts\"&gt;\nimport { onUnmounted } from 'vue';\n\nonUnmounted(() =&gt; {\n  console.log('Blade has been unmounted (closed).');\n  // Cleanup resources, listeners, etc.\n});\n</code></pre></li> <li>For the Caller: Similar to <code>onOpen</code>, you can provide an <code>onClose</code> callback in the <code>navigation</code> options when opening a blade. This function is called when the blade is unmounted (e.g., after it emits <code>close:blade</code> and the navigation system processes the closure, or if closed programmatically).     <pre><code>const { openBlade } = useBladeNavigation();\nawait openBlade({\n  blade: { name: 'MyTargetBlade' },\n  onClose: () =&gt; {\n    console.log('MyTargetBlade was closed by the navigation system.');\n    // Perform actions after the target blade has closed, e.g., refresh data.\n  }\n});\n</code></pre></li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Expanding and Collapsing:</p> <ul> <li>Blades can signal their intent to expand or collapse by emitting <code>expand:blade</code> or <code>collapse:blade</code> events respectively (typically in response to user interaction with controls within the blade, like header buttons).</li> <li>The <code>VcBlade</code> component itself handles these events and updates its internal state, which can also be reflected in the <code>maximized</code> property of the <code>IBladeInstance</code> (accessible via <code>useBlade()</code>).</li> <li>If a blade needs to react internally to being expanded or collapsed, it can watch its <code>expanded</code> prop (if passed and managed by a parent) or the <code>maximized</code> state from its injected <code>BladeInstance</code>.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>Programmatic Navigation with <code>useBladeNavigation</code>:</p> <p>The <code>useBladeNavigation</code> composable allows for programmatic control of blades, primarily for opening one blade from another within or between modules.
