# Overview

Database agnostic architecture is a design strategy that allows an application to function with any database, regardless of its vendor or type.

Virto Commerce has full DB agnostic support for e-commerce modules and offers unlimited scalability - our customers have the flexibility to choose the best-in-breed database. We offer a range of out-of-the-box database providers, including Microsoft SQL Server, MySql, and PostgreSql.

## Architecture principles

Our architecture follows key principles to ensure stability, flexibility, and maintainability:

* **No breaking changes**: Safe updates without disrupting existing solutions.
* **Entity Framework 6**.
* **Database provider isolation**: DB-specific code is isolated per project to avoid affecting the core.
* **Customization support**: Designed to support solution customization.
