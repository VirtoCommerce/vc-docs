        * Lucene.
        * Elasticsearch.

        !!! note
            You can [tailor the search provider per document type](https://docs.virtocommerce.org/platform/developer-guide/Configuration-Reference/appsettingsjson/#search) to optimize search performance and functionality.

## Incremental index updates

Virto Commerce can update search indexes incrementally in the background by tracking entity changes and injecting changed entities into the index.

Various modules have their own jobs and settings. For example, the Catalog module has two types for incremental indexing:

* **Event-based**: Indexing is triggered when a product gets changed.
* **Time-based**: A background job checks and re-indexes modified objects every X minutes (5 by default). This type is disabled by default.

To disable/ enable event-based indexing:

1. Click **Settings** in the main menu.
1. In the next blade, type **Search** to find settings related to the module.
1. Select **Enable event-based indexing** for the required module.
1. In the next blade, switch the option to off or on.
1. Click **Save** in the top toolbar to save the changes.
