## Key features

With the Loyalty module, users can:

* **Manage programs**: Create and configure loyalty programs with conditions, reward rules (fixed points or % of order value), priorities, activation periods, and localized names.
* **Track transactions**: Log point accruals and redemptions, and monitor customer activity and balance changes.
* **Enable loyalty payments**: Use the built-in **LoyaltyPaymentMethod** to let customers pay with points at checkout.
    * Points can only be used if the balance fully covers the order amount.
    * Conversion rate: **1 point = 1 unit of order currency**.
