# Overview

The **Page Builder** module allows you to create e-commerce pages from blocks and edit them using a visual editor. Unlike the Content module, which only supports creating and editing pages using Markdown and HTML, the Page Builder module provides a more intuitive, visual approach. However, it is required to have the [Content module](../content/overview.md#installation) installed first, as the Page Builder module is accessed through the Content module interface.
