# Search options

When dealing with numerous records, you will require searching and filtering options to efficiently locate the specific items you're looking for. Virto Commerce provides two searching options:

* [Keyword search](search.md#keyword-search)
* [Filtering](search.md#filtering)

## Keyword search

The most straightforward approach to locating an item is by utilizing the keyword search. Simply enter a keyword or a portion thereof into the keyword search bar, and the results you require will be generated:

![Keyword search](contacts/media/keyword_search.png){: width="400" height="400"}

## Filtering

=== "Using default filters"

    To use default filters, open the dropdown list:

    ![Default filters](contacts/media/filters.png)

=== "Adding new filter"

    Click ![Pencil](catalog/media/pencil.png){: width="25" height="25"} to create your own custom filters. These new filters can be based on record content, creation dates, etc. To configure a filter, provide a search phrase. The user interface offers reference guidance on utilizing different search phrases:

    ![Custom filter screen](contacts/media/custom_filter_screen.png)

    In the example above, the filter is set to show all records created between November, 9 and November 11, 2022.

    Once you save your new filter, it will appear in the filters list:

    ![New filter in the list](contacts/media/new-filter-in-list.png)

    The filter parameters can be edited at any time.
