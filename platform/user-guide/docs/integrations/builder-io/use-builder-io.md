# Use Builder.io

Builder.io is an intuitive solution that allows anyone on your team to manage Frontend Application pages without having to rely on developers. As long as Virto Frontend Application has native integration with Builder.io, you can start using it right away:

1. Open Platform.
1. Click ![Dots](media/nine-dots-icon1.png){: width="25"} to open applications menu.
1. Click **Builder.io**. The Builder.io dashboard opens in a new window. 
1. If required, select a space from the list.
1. Click **New entry** to [create a new page](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/create-page#creating-a-page). 

    !!! note
        At this step, you may need to add site URL. Go to **Settings** --> **Space** tab --> **Site URL** --> **Edit**

1. The newly created page already contains a header and a footer that maintain the UI and design of the Virto Frontend Application:

    ![Header and footer](media/header-footer.png)

    The left sidebar contains builder.io components and Virto Commerce custom components. If necessary, users can [add their own custom components](https://www.builder.io/c/docs/custom-components-intro) or edit the existing ones:

    ![Custom components](media/custom-components.png)

    For example, you can add an **N-pinned products** component to a custom category page. You can create fully customized category pages that include not only standard products but also specifically curated products that remain pinned:

    ![N-pinned-products](media/n-pinned-products.png)
