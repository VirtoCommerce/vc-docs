# Orders Synchronization

The AvalaraTax module creates AvaTax transactions for orders and enables scheduled synchronization of VC Platform orders with AvaTax. 

It creates a **SalesInvoice** transaction for orders, where:

* Document code matches order number.
* Document date matches order date.
* Line items contain all line items from the order plus one more line item for the shipping.

You can send the order to AvaTax:

* Automatically: 
    * Enable the `Avalara.Tax.ScheduledOrdersSynchronization.IsEnabled` setting.
    * Adjust the schedule in the `Avalara.TaxScheduledOrdersSynchronization.CronExpression` setting.
    * Wait for the job to complete.
* Manually:
    * For a single order: 
        1. In the main menu, click **Orders** to open the **Order details** blade.
        1. Click the required order.
        1. In the **Edit order details** blade, click the **AvaTax** widget.
        1. Click **Send to AvaTax** in the **Details of AvaTax transaction** blade.
        1. The report of the process results appears in the next blade.

        1. Check the required orders.
        1. Click **Send to AvaTax** in the top menu.
        1. The report of the process results appears in the next blade. The orders are sent to Avalara only for the stores that use AvaTax as their tax provider.
