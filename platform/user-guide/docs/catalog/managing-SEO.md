# Manage SEO

Users can now configure SEO information for the root catalog. It can be applied to catalog, category, subcategory and product levels on the website to enhance search engine optimization. Additionally, users have the option to disable access to the catalog if needed.

As an example, let's enable SEO for the **Bolts** category within the **B2B-mixed** catalog:

1. Click **Catalog** in the main menu. 
1. In the next blade, select the **B2B-mixed** catalog.
1. In the next blade, click the three dots to the left of the **Bolts** category and select **Manage** from the dropdown list.
1. In the next blade, click on the **SEO** widget.
