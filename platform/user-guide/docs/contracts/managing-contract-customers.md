1. In the next blade, click the **Customers** widget.

1. In the next blade, click **Add** to open the list of contacts and organizations.

    ![Add companies](media/add-customers1.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" }

1. Check the companies you need to add to your contract. 

1. Click **Confirm** in the toolbar.

    ![Add companies](media/add-customers2.png){: style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" width="350"}

The specified companies have now been added to the contract. This also adds all child companies and related contacts, so it is not necessary to add each user individually.
