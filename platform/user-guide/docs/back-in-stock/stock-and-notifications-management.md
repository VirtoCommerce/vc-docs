# Inventory and Notifications Management  

See how [changing a product’s stock quantity](../inventory/managing-inventory.md#edit-inventory) affects its frontend representation:  

![Zero stock](media/zero-stock.gif)  

Customers can [subscribe to back-in-stock notifications](/storefront/user-guide/latest/shopping/back-in-stock-notifications). Once the product is restocked, the Platform immediately [logs and sends email notifications](../notifications/notification-log.md#notification-activity-feed).  

The [notification template](../notifications/notification-templates.md) is editable.
