# Overview

The Back-in-stock module helps customers stay informed when products are available again. It also helps sellers  retain potential sales for out-of-stock items. This module lets customers subscribe to real-time notifications when products are restocked. This raises customers satisfaction and reduces the abandoned purchases. Sellers have a clear view of what their customers want through a simple, centralized back office interface. This helps sellers plan their inventory with ease.
