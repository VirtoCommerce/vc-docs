## Blades

The Virto Commerce Platform's UI is organized and divided into multiple screens called blades. Blades are ordered left to right and share parent-child hierarchy. Any parent blade has one or more child blades, while every child has a reference to its parent. The hierarchy depth is unlimited. 

To access a module, click on it in the main menu. Its content will appear in the next blade. Manage the module's content using the buttons in the top toolbar or by clicking the three dots next to the item's name:
