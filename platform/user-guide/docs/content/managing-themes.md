# Themes

The Virto Commerce Theme is a frontend application for your ecommerce websites. The default Theme is included in the VC Content module and is provided out of the box. The default theme consists of the following folders with files that define the Frontend Application UI:

| Folder        	| Content                                                                                                    	|
|---------------	|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| **assets**    	| Scripts, styles and other assets compiled and minified for production.                                     	|
| **config**    	| The Virto theme settings. It contains: <br> **menu.json** with the theme menu settings.<br>**routes.json** (autogenerated) with SPA routes for Storefront application.<br>**settings_data.json** with theme configurations. You can enable/ disable quotes and product comparison, set limits for the lists, set statuses for quotes and orders, and much more. <br> The **presets** folder is used to store predefined configurations for the theme. These presets can be quickly applied to the theme to [achieve a specific look without having to manually configure all settings](managing-themes.md#manage-theme-color-configurations). <br> The **schemas** folder contains JSON schema files that define the structure and possible values for the settings used in the theme. These schemas serve as templates that describe what settings are available, what types of values they can accept, and any validation rules.|
| **layouts**   	| Layout templates used to render the theme within the Storefront.                                              |
| **locales**   	| Locale files used to provide translated content for the theme.                                             	|
| **snippets**  	| Liquid snippets, included in Liquid templates.                                                             	|
| **templates** 	| Liquid templates, used in SSR and MPA. Each MPA page must have a liquid template here if you want SSR. 	    |
