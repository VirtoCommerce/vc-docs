## Apply theme color scheme

Users can personalize their store by applying a [custom theme](/storefront/developer-guide/latest/customization/visual-theme-customization) or choosing from the ready-to-use color schemes designed by Virto Commerce. Each release includes a set of default color presets, with new ones added several times a year. To access the latest default color presets, users can simply download the updated theme. Currently, the following out-of-the-box color schemes can be applied to your store:

=== "purple-pink"

    ![purple-pink](media/purple.png)

=== "black-gold"

    ![Black](media/black.png)

=== "watermelon"

    ![Watermelon](media/watermelon.png)

=== "coffee"

    ![Coffee](media/coffee.png)

=== "ocean"

    ![Ocean](media/ocean.png)

=== "peach"

    ![Peach](media/peach.png)


![Readmore](media/readmore.png){: width="25"} [Theme customization](/storefront/developer-guide/latest/customization/visual-theme-customization)


To apply a new color scheme to your store:

1. Select one of the out-of-the-box color schemes or your custom scheme and copy its name without extension to clipboard (for example, **watermelon**):
1. Go to **Stores** --> Your store --> **White labeling**.
1. In the **White labeling** blade, click ![Pencil](media/pencil.png){: width="25"} next to the **Theme preset name**.
1. In the next blade, click **Add** in the toolbar.
1. Paste the filename to the new field and click ![Floppy](media/floppy.png){: width="25"} to save the changes.
1. Click **Save** in the toolbar.
1. In the previous blade, select the newly added theme from the dropdown list. 
1. Click **Save** in the toolbar. 

Your new color scheme has been applied.
