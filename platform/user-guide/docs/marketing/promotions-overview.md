# Promotions

Promotion is a marketing tool used to increase sales. In Virto Commerce, you can add many different types of promotions to your stores, such as discounts, shipping discounts, or gifts. You can also create or import coupons that can be used later by your customers.

Each promotion is valid under specific [conditions](promotion-rules.md) you can configure, and may provide one or more rewards.

In Virto, promotions are highly customizable and include conditions for customers who meet specific criteria, currencies, products, stock levels, and more.
	
For example, you can configure that customers who live in New York City and purchase two of the last smartphones will receive 75% off shipping and two free phone cases.

Promotions can be store-specific or shared across multiple stores.
