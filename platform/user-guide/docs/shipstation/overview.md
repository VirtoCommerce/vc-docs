# Overview

The **ShipStation** module enables synchronizing customer orders with [ShipStation](http://www.shipstation.com/). This means that new orders with shipments placed in VirtoCommerce will become available in the ShipStation admin, and changes in shipment status will be synced with VirtoCommerce orders.
