## Update contacts

The procedure for updating contacts is similar to the one for [importing contacts](managing-contacts.md#import-contacts). The system finds organizations by Id or outer Id and updates them. 

## Assign multiple organizations to contacts and employees

For corporate accounts in the Frontend Application, you can assign multiple organizations to any contact or employee:

1. Click **Contacts** in the main menu.
1. In the **Companies and Contacts** blade, select the required contact. 
1. In the next blade, add as many companies to the **Member of company (ies)** segment as needed from the dropdown list.
1. Click **Save** in the top toolbar to save the changes.
