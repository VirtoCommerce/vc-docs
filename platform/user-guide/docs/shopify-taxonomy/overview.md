# Overview

The **Shopify Taxonomy** module allows you to import Shopify's standard product taxonomy into the Virto Commerce Catalog. It improves the performance and quality of new catalog configurations with open-source taxonomies and attributes.

[Shopify's Standard Product Taxonomy](https://shopify.github.io/product-taxonomy/) serves as an open-source, standardized, and global classification of products sold on Shopify. Composed of product categories, attributes, and attribute values, the taxonomy is leveraged across Shopify and is integrated with numerous marketplaces.
