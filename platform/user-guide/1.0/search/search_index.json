They can launch stores in different regions with different languages and currencies while maintaining a single ecosystem of applications and a unified process for order processing and customer service. One of the significant advantages of Virto Commerce architecture is the ability to scale ecommerce to regions without multiple platform installations for regional markets. This approach saves on IT infrastructure and personnel costs. The IT team can serve the Platform for all markets, adding only staff with language skills as needed to support local customers. In contrast, other competing platforms require duplicating the ecommerce platform for each new region, resulting in unnecessary duplication of IT resources and team costs. The Virto Commerce architecture naturally avoids cost duplication. When launching a new ecommerce business in different regions, the infrastructure that serves it remains the same or grows insignificantly. To scale the Virto Commerce ecommerce Platform to new regional markets, it is recommended to install it at a cloud provider such as Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud, or Alibaba Cloud.</p> <p> </p> \u2190 Getting started  Viewing results on Frontend \u2192"},{"location":"platform-overview/","title":"Overview","text":"<p>Virto Commerce is a modular Platform.

Don\u2019t put more than one value for the same property in a single variation - shoppers can only pick one value per property, and if a variation has Size: L and XL, the system can\u2019t tell which one to use.</p> <p>Good examples:</p> <ul> <li>T\u2011shirt variation: Size = L, Color = Red</li> <li>Shoes variation: Size = 42, Color = Black</li> </ul> <p>Bad examples:</p> <ul> <li>T\u2011shirt variation: Size = L and XL</li> <li>Jacket variation: Color = \u201cBlue / Navy\u201d (two colors in one variation)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Use the same variation properties for every variation: Choose the set of variation properties for the product (e.g., Size and Color) and use those same properties for all variations. Keep property names the same everywhere - the store shows a single set of properties to the shopper, and if some variations are missing a property or use a different name, the selection becomes confusing or impossible to finish.</p> <p>Good examples:</p> <ul> <li>All T\u2011shirt variations have both Size and Color</li> <li>All Sofa variations have Width and Fabric</li> </ul> <p>Bad examples:</p> <ul> <li>Some T\u2011shirt variations have Size and Color; others only have Size</li> <li>Mixing names: Color on some variations and Colour on others</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Each combination must point to exactly one variation: Any set of chosen values (e.g., Size: L + Color: Red) should match ONLY ONE variation. Don\u2019t create two variations with the same full set of values - after a shopper makes their choices, the system must find exactly one item to buy, and if two variations share the same values, the result is unclear.</p> <p>Good examples:</p> <ul> <li>Size: M + Color: Blue exists only once in the product</li> <li>Every Size/Color pair is unique</li> </ul> <p>Bad examples:</p> <ul> <li>Two variations with Size: M + Color: Red</li> <li>Copies where only the SKU differs but the properties are identical</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Make sure the product is actually selectable: If your product has more than one variation, you must add at least one variation property (like Size or Color) so shoppers can choose. If the product has only one variation, either add a simple one\u2011value property (e.g., Size: One Size) so it auto\u2011selects, or allow buying without variations. The system can finish the selection only when it can match one specific variation. With multiple variations and no properties, shoppers can\u2019t choose which one; with zero properties, the system won\u2019t produce a final selection.</p> <p>Good examples:</p> <ul> <li>Hoodie with multiple variations: has Size and Color</li> <li>Single\u2011variation belt: Size: One Size (auto\u2011selects) or is buyable without variations</li> </ul> <p>Bad examples:</p> <ul> <li>Product has 3 variations but no variation properties (no way to choose)</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"catalog/managing-product-variations/#quick-checklist","title":"Quick checklist","text":"<ul> <li>One value per variation property.</li> <li>Same variation properties on every variation.</li> <li>No duplicate value combinations.</li> <li>Multi\u2011variation products: at least one variation property.

However, an actual index name is created dynamically: this is a special alphanumeric token suffix added to the end of the index name. The only way to tell which index is active is to look at its alias.
