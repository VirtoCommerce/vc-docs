# Store Branding

Once your store is created, you can customize its branding by:

* Replacing the default Virto Commerce logo and favicon with your own.
* Updating the native theme colors to reflect your corporate brand.

## Prepare logos and favicon

For test purposes, you can use any PNG, GIF, or SVG image (for logo) or PNG, JPEG, or WEBP image (for favicon).   

For finalized branding, you can prepare logo and favicon images according to the requirements in our [figma project](https://www.figma.com/design/tSeAtWkt4DOj0khZ8Fi8wY/%F0%9F%90%B3-OCEAN-BLUE-%E2%80%A2-Storefront-screens?node-id=4142-36381&t=hwbdIQc7jxZ4YJPZ-4) or use it as a sample as follows:

1. Clone the project.
1. Replace logos and favicon with your own images.
1. Use the preview feature to evaluate the result.
1. Export the final version of your images.

Now, you can use the images to replace default logos and favicon.
