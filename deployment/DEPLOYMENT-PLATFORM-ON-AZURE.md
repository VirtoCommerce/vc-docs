### Troubleshooting

Sometimes the deployment process fails while **Running deployment command**:

![Deployment error](./images/image2015-8-3_12-24-53.png "Deployment error")

Clicking the green (View Error) link will not explain anything, you should go to Azure Portal and check the deployment log.

Open Web Apps and select your recenly created web app.Click on **Active Deployment** widget.In the **Deployments** list click on the failed deployment.In the **Deployment Details** click **View Log**.The most frequent error is related to downloading packages from NuGet. This is a temporary issue and in most cases clicking **Redeploy** in Deployment Details blade leads to successful deployment.

### Updating to the latest version

Open Web App settings.Open **Deployment source**.Click **Sync** button in the toolbar.

This operation will download the latest source code from GitHub repository, compile it, copy the result to the wwwroot directory and restart the web site.

### Storage requirements

Precompiled <a class="crosslink" href="https://virtocommerce.com/b2b-ecommerce-platform" target="_blank">Virto Commerce</a> Manager with storefront take about 130 MB. When using the Deploy to Azure button on GitHub, the Azure web app downloads the source code and compiles it on the Azure web app - this takes about 800 MB. This means even the F1 (free) service plan is enough to host both web applications. S2 has 50 GB of storage, which is more than enough for both applications and product assets (images) of very large catalog. So when choosing between S2 and P2 you should only consider the performance of these instances. 

Also it is advisable to store product assets in a separate blob storage (Azure Storage Account).
