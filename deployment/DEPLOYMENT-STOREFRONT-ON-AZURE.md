### Storage requirements

Precompiled <a class="crosslink" href="https://virtocommerce.com/b2b-ecommerce-platform" target="_blank">Virto Commerce</a> Manager with storefront take about 130 MB. When using the Deploy to Azure button on GitHub, the Azure web app downloads the source code and compiles it on the Azure web app - this takes about 800 MB. This means even the F1 (free) service plan is enough to host both web applications. S2 has 50 GB of storage, which is more than enough for both applications and product assets (images) of very large catalog. So when choosing between S2 and P2 you should only consider the performance of these instances. 

Also it is advisable to store product assets in a separate blob storage (Azure Storage Account).
