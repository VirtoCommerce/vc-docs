# Overview

Page search function helps users retrieve page information from a specific shop in the Virto Commerce xAPI Module. 

Here are some examples of use:

* Display page list: The query allows you to get a list of pages with their relative URLs and names. This can be useful for creating a navigation menu or displaying a list of available pages in your application or interface.

* Search pages by keyword: The query allows you to filter pages by returning only those that contain a certain keyword. For example, you can search for pages related to a certain topic or category.

* Pagination and big data management: The query supports pagination, which means that you can retrieve data pages in batches. This is useful when you have a large number of pages and want to retrieve them gradually or display them in a page-by-page navigation.

* Integrate with other services: Captured page data can be used to integrate with other systems or services. For example, you may be able to use the derived page URLs to generate links or to index pages in search engines.
