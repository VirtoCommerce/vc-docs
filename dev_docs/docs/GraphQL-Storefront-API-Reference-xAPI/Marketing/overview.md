# X-Marketing 

The X-Marketing module is a powerful new tool for e-commerce businesses that provides high-performance search queries for dynamic content. This module makes it easier for users to evaluate dynamic content, such as banners and slideshows, based on dynamic conditions.

One of its key features is its ability to evaluate dynamic content based on conditions, such as customer behavior or the time of day. This allows businesses to create targeted and personalized experiences for their customers, increasing engagement and conversions.
