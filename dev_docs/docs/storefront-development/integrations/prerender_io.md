# Enhancing SEO with Prerender.io

The current Virto Commerce theme, vc-theme-b2b-vue, uses the power of Single Page Applications (SPAs) to provide a unique, interactive, and fast user experience. However, while SPAs excel in user experience, they often pose challenges for search engines due to their dynamic nature. This dynamic behavior, which is a strength for user engagement, can become a hurdle in attracting organic traffic.

To overcome these challenges and strike a balance between an engaging user experience and search engine optimization (SEO), [Prerender.io](http://prerender.io/) represents as a valuable solution. Prerender.io generates pre-rendered HTML snapshots for SPAs, significantly improving SEO-friendliness and Web Vitals metrics. This integration doesn't require the adoption of complex Server-Side Rendering (SSR) frameworks like Next or Nuxt, preserving the simplicity of the presentation application. This guide explores how Prerender.io provides a straightforward yet highly effective solution to boost the visibility, performance, and overall experience of Vue.js SPAs.

## Integration with vc-theme-b2b-vue

In this guide, we describe the results of Prerender.io  integration with the vc-theme-b2b-vue. A practical example is our site, [https://vcmp-dev-storefront.paas.govirto.com](https://vcmp-dev-storefront.paas.govirto.com), which is built on vc-theme-b2b-vue and uses the Prerender.io service.

### Configuration Details
