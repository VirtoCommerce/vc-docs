# Seq log module

Seq is a log management solution that complements logging libraries like Serilog and Application Insights. It provides a centralized platform for storing, searching, and analyzing log data. While Application Insights is a log management and monitoring service offered by Microsoft Azure, Seq can be used as an alternative if you're not using the Azure platform or if you prefer a different log management solution.

Seq allows you to centralize and analyze log data generated by various logging libraries and frameworks. Seq provides a web-based interface for searching, filtering, and visualizing log events, making it easier to monitor and troubleshoot applications.

The VC platform Seq module comes with a [sink](https://github.com/datalust/serilog-sinks-seq) for Serilog that writes events to Seq. 

To enable logging:

1. Download the [Seq module](https://github.com/VirtoCommerce/vc-module-seq-log/releases/latest).

1. Update the following `Serilog` configuration sections:

  ```JSON title="appsettings.json"
  {
    "Serilog": {
      "Using": [
        ...
        "Serilog.Sinks.Seq"
      ],
      "WriteTo": [
        {
          "Name": "Seq", 
          "Args": {
            "apiKey": "[your api key]",
            "serverUrl": "http://localhost:5341"
          }
        }
      ],
      ...
    },
  }
  ```
