# Overview

Dynamic views allow you to use built-in components within VC Shell to create new views using a new style of description - schemas. Dynamic views under the hood leverage standard components from the VC Shell UI kit but in a slightly modified wrapper. In most cases, all the input data passed to the component when creating the schema use the same names as the component parameters. For the convenience of schema creation, each available component has its new interface.

This guide will explain which components are available for use in dynamic views and what capabilities they offer.
