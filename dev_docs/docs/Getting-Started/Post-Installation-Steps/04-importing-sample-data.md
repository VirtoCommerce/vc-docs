# Importing Sample Data

To make it easier for you to explore what Virto Commerce can do, we provide a sample data set that you can import to automatically populate various entities. On the first launch, the platform displays a wizard that will prompt you to choose and import sample data. Currently, we only offer *Clothing and Electronics* sample data set that includes products, categories, customers, and other demo data that can assist developers and platform managers with learning how Virto Commerce works.

In some cases, however, you may want to skip this step when getting started and import sample data later. In so, you will need to do this manually later on.

## Importing Sample Data Manually

To manually install sample data, open *More → Settings → Platform → Setup* in the Virto Commerce platform and click the *Import Sample Data* widget:

Select *Clothing and Electronics* in the popup window that will show up and wait until the sample data has been downloaded and imported into your system. Once finished, you will have a complete sample data set that is ready to use.
