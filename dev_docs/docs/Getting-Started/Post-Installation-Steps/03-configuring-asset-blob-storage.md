# Configuring Asset Blob Storage

This guide will explain you how to configure Asset blob storage, an abstraction that works as a single point of access to all media files in your online store. Such files could be product images or attachments, PDF specs, etc., regardless of their location or protocol.

By default, the platform allows you to configure one of the following blob storage providers:

-   `FileSystem`
    
-   `AzureBlobStorage`

## Setting Up FileSystem Asset Storage in Development Mode

This provider uses the local file system to store and provide public access to all media files. This mode implements [Static files in ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/static-files?view=aspnetcore-6.0), with all files are stored within the app local directory. The FileSystem storage provides public access to the files via relative URIs. To switch platform to using this provider, you need to edit the `Assets` section of the `appsetting.json` file so that it may look like this:

`appsetting.json`
```json
1 "Assets": {
2        "Provider": "FileSystem",
3        "FileSystem": {
4            "RootPath": "~/assets",
5            "PublicUrl": "https://localhost:5001/assets/"
6        }
7    },
```

!!! note
    * Line 2: Specify `FileSystem` as your default asset provider.
	* Line 4: For `RootPath`, provide the base path to the `wwwroot` directory inside app folder.
	*Line 5: Provide the base URL that will be used when generating a public URI [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/ "http://ASP.NET") Core app serves directly. Make sure both host and port are up-to-date and valid for your platform instance.

## Example

Let's assume you have an image file named `MyImage.jpg` that is stored at `wwwroot/assets/MyImage.jpg`. This file will be accessible through `https://localhost:5001/assets/MyImage.jpg` (a public URI), since [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/ "http://ASP.NET") marks all files in [wwwroot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/?view=aspnetcore-6.0#web-root "https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/?view=aspnetcore-6.0#web-root") as servable.

!!! note
    * This mode is good for local development purposes and not recommended for production because it lacks scalability.

### Setting up Azure Blob Storage in Production Mode

Before setting up Azure blob storage, you will first need to create one.  This [quick start guide by Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-portal) will explain you how.

Once your blob storage has been created, open `appsettings.json` and add the connection string under the `Assets` section. As a result, the `Assets` section should look like this:

`appsetting.json`
```json
1 "Assets": {
2        "Provider": "AzureBlobStorage",
3        "AzureBlobStorage": {
4            "ConnectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<media account name>;AccountKey=<media account key>;EndpointSuffix=core.windows.net"
5        }
6    },
```

!!! note
    * Line 2: Specify `AzureBlobStorage` as your default asset provider.
	* Line 4: In `ConnectionString`, provide the connection string of your storage account.

!!! tip
    * You can get your connection string from your Azure Portal under the Access Keys section.

!!! note
    * This mode is recommended for using in production environment since it enables sharing the asset storage across multiple platform instances.
