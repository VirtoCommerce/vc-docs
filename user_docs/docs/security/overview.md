# Overview

Virto Commerce Security module provides various options to manage security and authentication for your online store or website. This includes managing:

* **Users**: Individuals with access to your platform or store.
* **Roles**: Sets of permissions defining specific functions within the platform, such as basic user, advanced user, administrator, order manager, etc.
* **Permissions**: Fundamental security units that grant particular rights to perform actions, such as viewing customer details or changing order data.
* **Scopes**: Restrictions of permissions to specific objects or actions.

## Key Features

With the Security module, you can:

* [Create user accounts](managing-users.md#create-new-user).
* [Assign various roles to users](managing-users.md). Each role includes specific granular permissions that give or restrict access to specific features within the platform. This is useful when you want to restrict access to a specific store or do not want regular platform users to edit sensitive data.
* [Generate API keys](api-key.md) for specific users.
* [Log in to Storefront on behalf](login-on-behalf.md) of any user.
