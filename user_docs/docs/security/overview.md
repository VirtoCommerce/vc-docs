# Overview
Virto's Security service provides various options to manage security and authentication for your online store or website. This includes managing users, roles, permissions, and more.

## Core Entities
In Virto, the security system is composed of three main entities:

1.  Permission: A basic security unit that provides a particular right to perform an action, e.g., to view customer details, to change order data, etc.
    
2.  Role: A set of permissions defining a particular function within the platform, e.g., basic user, advanced user, administrator, order manager, etc. 
    
3.  Scope: Enables restricting permissions to specific objects or actions.

## Key Features
See below for the key features provided within the Security service.

### Role-Based Security
Role-based security allows you to assign various roles to the users based on what they need access to. Each role includes specific granular permissions that give access to specific features within the platform.

For more information on managing roles in Virto, go [here](roles-and-permissions.md).

### Bounded Scope
This feature enables restricting user access to particular objects, which you can select manually or based on a rule. For example, this may come in handy when you want to restrict access to a specific store or do not want regular platform users to edit sensitive data.

### Users
In Virto Commerce, you can create user accounts and assign specific roles and permissions to them.

For more information on how to create and manage user accounts in Virto, refer to [this guide](managing-users.md).
