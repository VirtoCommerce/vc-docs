## Create new users and assign roles to them

After installing Virto Commerce Platform, a single user with administrator rights will be automatically created. Following this, you will need to create additional users and assign roles to them based on your company's requirements. Only users with administrator rights possess the permission to manage users and roles.

To create new users and assign roles to them:

1. Click **Security** in the main menu.
1. In the next blade, click **Users** to open the **Users** blade.
1. Click **Add** in the toolbar.
