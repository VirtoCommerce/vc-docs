+ Price
+ Price list
+ Price list assignment

## Price

The price entity stores the item price supports static discounts and tier prices. It's key properties are:

+ ***Product*** (required): Item the current price refers to.

+ ***Mininum quantity*** (the minimum value is 1): The lowest number of items possible, with which the price is valid.

## Price List

A price list is, technically, a container that stores prices in a single currency. Its key properties are:

+ ***Prices***: List of prices included into the price list.

## Price List Assignment

Price list assignments enable associating  specific price lists with catalogs based on the relevant rules and conditions.  

Any price list assignment has the following key properties:

+ ***Price list*** (required) - relation to selected pricelist.  
+ ***Catalog*** (required) - relation to selected catalog.
+ ***Enable*** (start) and ***Expiration dates*** â€“ the specified Enabled and Expiration dates determine the validation period of the pricelist assignment.  
+ ***Priority***  defines the priority of the Pricelist. The system will apply the pricelist that has the highest priority.
