# Checkout

Checkout is the final stage of the online shopping process where customers provide payment and shipping information, review their order, and confirm the purchase.

1. Click **Proceed to checkout**.

    !!! note
        The checkout process for carts containing only digital products does not include the **Shipping** step since digital products do not require shipping.

1. Specify shipping details:
    * Select a shipping address from the list or add a new one.
    * Select a delivery method from a drop-down list: Ground or Air. The shipping cost appears in the order summary.
    * Enter your comments, if any.

1. Specify payment details:
    * Select a shipping address from the list, add new one, or check **Same as shipping address**. 
    * Select a payment method from the drop-down list. Selecting payment by bank card adds the **Payment** step to the checkout process. It does not appear if you choose to pay manually. Manual payment allows you to pay for the order later.
