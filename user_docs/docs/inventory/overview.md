# Overview
Virto's Inventory module enables tracking the stock level and managing fulfillment centers.

Generally, inventory is often the largest item a business has, meaning it must be accurately monitored. The inventory is counted and valued at the end of each accounting period to determine the company profits or losses.

In the ecommerce sector, day-to-day inventory management helps increase business intelligence and visibility. Ecommerce business owners have better ongoing control when they constantly keep an eye on their inventory.
