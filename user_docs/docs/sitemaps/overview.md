# Overview
Sitemaps are an easy way for webmasters to inform search engines about the pages on their websites that are available for crawling. In its simplest form, a sitemap is an XML file that lists URLs for a website along with additional metadata about each URL, i.e. when it was last updated, how often it usually gets changed, and how important it is in terms of other URLs on the website; thus, the search engines can crawl the website in a more intelligent way.

Web crawlers usually discover pages from links within the website, as well as from other websites. Sitemaps supplement this data to allow crawlers that support Sitemaps to pick up all URLs in the sitemap and learn about those using the associated metadata. Using the sitemap protocol does not guarantee that web pages are included in search engines; however, it provides hints for web crawlers to do a better job while crawling your website.
