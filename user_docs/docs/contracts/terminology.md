# Terminology

This section lists the most important terms, along with their definitions, used in Virto's Contracts module.

**Contract**: A time-framed relation between the customer company (companies), the price list created within the contract, and the selected store.

**Contract name**: The name of the contract, which is visible in the contract list.

**Contract code**: A unique code of the contract. Once a contract is created, the system creates a user group with the name equal to the contract code. This user group will be terminated automatically once the associated contract is terminated.

**Start date** and **End date**: Dates that define the contract time frame; the contract is deemed within this date range.

**Modified price**: A price that is different from the default price because it was updated by the user.

**Customers**: Companies and contacts the contract prices apply to.
