# Thumbnails Module

Most likely, your online store will need images. Moreover, you will need not only full-size product images (which are stored in Virto's Assets module<!---link-->), but also smaller images, or thumbnails, to fit product lists, search results, previews, catalog grid view, etc.

Generating thumbnails manually is arguably a tedious task, especially when it comes to hundreds or thousands of various products. This is when Virto's *Thumbnail* module comes into play. It allows you to quickly and efficiently generate any reasonable number of small images with predefined sizes. Additionally, this generation runs as a job, which means you can schedule it to run every specific period of time to cover the recently added images as well.
