Once you have successfully generated thumbnails for your images, you can access it just by adding suffix with the required resolution (defined by options siffix) to original image url

For example, if the original image is accessible by this url

```url
https://localhost/assets/catalog/my-cool-image.jpg
```

if we have generated thumbnails with options having the following suffixes: `64x64` and `small` the resulting thumbnail URLs
will become:

```url
https://localhost/assets/catalog/my-cool-image_64x64.jpg
```

and 

```url
https://localhost/assets/catalog/my-cool-image_small.jpg
```
respectively.
