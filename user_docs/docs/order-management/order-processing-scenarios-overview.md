# Basic Order Processing Scenarios

Order processing includes the steps involved in fulfilling a customer's order: receiving and reviewing the order, verifying payment and stock availability, picking and packing the items, shipping the order, and updating the customer on the order status. 

The basic order processing scenarios are:

* [Getting invoice PDF](getting-invoice-pdf.md).
* [Creating a new shipment document](new-shipment-document.md).
* [Creating a new payment document](new-payment-document.md).
* [Creating a new refund document](new-refund-document.md)
* [Tracking order changes](tracking-order-changes.md).
* [Creating returns](creating-returns.md).
* [Processing returns](processing-returns.md).
* [Sending order information to AvaTax](sending-order-information-to-avatax.md).
