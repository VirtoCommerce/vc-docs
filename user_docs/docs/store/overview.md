# Overview
Virto Commerce's Store module represents a way to efficiently manage your online stores from a single point.

Technically, a store in Virto Commerce is a collection of settings for your web page or website that converts it into an appropriate online store you need. For each store, you can configure an item catalog to showcase, available currencies, languages, payment methods, even UI themes, pages, and much more. The Virto Commerce team supplies default storefront settings, as well as some sample stores, so that you could better understand how it works, right after you decide to build your own store with Virto.
