# Configuring Your Store
Once you have [created your new store](adding-new-store.md) and selected it in the store list, you will see your store screen with all settings and properties available:

![Store settings screen](media/all-store-settings.png)

As you can see, the store settings are very diverse. However, all of them are neatly grouped into two sections: fields and widgets.

## Field Settings
The field settings appear on the top part of the ***Store Details*** screen:

![Field settings](media/store-settings-fields.png)

Here, you can:

+ Edit the store name (*not* the code)
+ Provide additional languages and currencies
+ Provide links to other stores, so that your customers may log in to all of them with the same credentials

!!! warning
	The store linking feature is still under development.

+ Specify store URL

## Widget Settings
Most additional store settings and properties are provided as widgets:

![Widget settings](media/store-settings-widgets.png)

The sections below explain what each widget is about.

### Assets
This widget allows you to manage assets (product images, thumbnails, etc.) for your store. Start by uploading files directly or create one or more folders to keep everything organized.

When creating a folder, please observe the naming conventions the system will prompt you to follow.

### SEO
You can have multiple SEO sets for your store pages. Each set includes meta title, meta description, keywords, URL slug, and more:

### Advanced Properties
Here, you can provide store description and specify location settings. You can also provide email contacts for your store:

![Advanced properties](media/advanced-properties.png)

!!! tip
	For regular email, provide the email address which common notifications will be coming from (e.g., purchase confirmation, order details, etc.). Use admin email for system notifications, such as password reset.

### Dynamic Properties
This widget enables configuring dynamic properties.

### Settings
This widget houses all specific settings you can configure for your store. Each setting has a tip which tells you what it is exactly about.

The Store module allows you to manage general settings, as well as SEO, Product Review, Sitemap, Google Analytics settings, and more.

!!! tip
	For more information on store settings, refer to this [dedicated guide](settings.md).

### Notification and Notification Log
These widgets help you configure notifications for your store and view the notification log. These properties are borrowed from Virto's Notifications module, which we describe in detail [here](https://docs.virtocommerce.org/new/user_docs/notifications/overview/).

### Aggregation properties
This widget allows you to configure aggregation properties for [faceted search](https://docs.virtocommerce.org/new/dev_docs/Fundamentals/Indexed-Search/search/faceted-search/).

### Shipping and Payment Methods
You can configure and activate various [shipping](link-to-shipping-methods) and [payment methods](link-to-payment-methods) for each individual store. As a user, you cannot add a new method through the Store module UI, so you will need assistance from your development team for that.

### Tax Providers
Similarly to the previous one, this widget allows you to configure and activate various [tax providers](link-to-tax-providers) for each individual store. Again, adding a new provider requires development effort.

### Fulfillment Centers
You can specify default and additional [fulfillment centers](link-to-fulfillment-centers) that will work with your store, as well as return fulfillment centers. Clicking the appropriate pencil icon will open the ***Fulfillment Centers*** screen, where you will be able to select the centers you need or add a new one:

![Fulfillment centers screen](media/fulfillment-center-screen.png)

### Theme
This widget will take you to the ***Content*** section, where you can specify the theme(s) for your store. You can read more about themes and visual content [here](link-to-themes).

### Sitemaps
Finally, this widget allows you to select and add sitemaps for your store. This is done through our dedicated ***Sitemaps*** module, which we cover in detail [here](link-to-sitemaps).

## Conclusion
Once you are done with settings, hit the ***Save*** button. Alternatively, you can click ***Open in browser*** to see how your store will look like for customers:
