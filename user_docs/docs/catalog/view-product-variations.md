## Asset Inheritance
A created product variation inherits all assets and their properties from a parent product automatically. All subsequent updates in the parent product assets are reflected in the variation assets. After the user edits or adds a new asset to the variation product the inheritance stops being automatic, the system makes a copy of parent assets and adds them to the variation so changes in the parent assets are no longer reflected in the **Variaitons**.
