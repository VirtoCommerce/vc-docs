# Managing products

A product is a basic entity that represents an item that can be purchased in an online store. The Catalog module allows you to work with the following types of products 

- Physical product: Any physical object, such as a camera or a cell phone.
- Digital product: Intangible products, such as software or music.
- Product with a bill of materials: A special type of product that has a list of additional materials required for a specific item.

Variations are individual product entities linked to their master product. For instance, a master product like a mobile phone can have variations like black, white, or red versions, or 5’’ and 6’’ models (or both).
Variations inherit property values from the master product, including descriptions and assets, while also allowing overrides when necessary.
