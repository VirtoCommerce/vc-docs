# Managing categories

A category is basically a container for other categories, subcategories, or products.

Categories enable building hierarchies and links between various items in the catalog, which helps the customers navigate to the items they would like to purchase.

If you have large catalogs containing many items, you might want to create multiple categories and subcategories using the parent-child structure.
