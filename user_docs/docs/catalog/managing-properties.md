# Managing properties

Custom properties are additional parameters for catalog entities at the follwing levels:

* Catalog level.
* Category level.
* Product level.
* Variation level.

All properties defined at a higher level are automatically inherited at all lower levels. For example, if you assign the **Brand** property with the value **XXX** to a catalog, all categories and products within that catalog will also have **XXX** as their **Brand**.
