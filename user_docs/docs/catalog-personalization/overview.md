# Overview

The core purpose of Virto's Catalog Personalization module is to customize catalogs, price lists, and marketing actions using tags and user groups to make them more convenient and useful for you.

## Key Features

1. Controlling the visibility of such catalog objects as products and categories through manually labelling them with the special ***Tag*** property. Tags may contain multiple predefined values, which can also be defined for customer profiles.
1. Tag propagation and inheritance across catalog objects, with [***UpTree*** and ***DownTree*** policies](tag-inheritance.md) in catalog object hierarchy.
1. Working with [***User groups***](user-groups.md) to filter products or categories in the Storefront search.
