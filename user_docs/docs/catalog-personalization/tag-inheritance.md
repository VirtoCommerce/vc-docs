# Tag Inheritance and Propagation

The tags you assign to catalog objects have an intrinsic *inheritance* feature, which is 'double-sword', i.e.:

+ With the ***UpTree*** policy, you can propagate your tags from children to parents, up in the hierarchy:

![UpTree policy](media/uptree-policy.png)
    
+ With the ***DownTree*** policy, children inherit the tags from parents, down the hierarchy:

![DownTree policy](media/downtree-policy.png)

For instance, using the UpTree policy, a category will inherit tags from its products, while with the DownTree policy, every product will get the same tags as its category.

## Setting Tag Propagation Policies

You can learn how to switch tag propagation policies, as well as manage other personalization settings, [here](settings.md).
