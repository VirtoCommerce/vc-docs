***Notes to the Chart:***

1.	You can have any number of stores. However, each store must have at least one catalog.
2.	A catalog may have multiple categories and/or products or may not have any at all.
3.	*Catalog* and *Product* are logical categories that may only appear as physical or virtual for the former, and physical or digital for the latter.
4.	While sharing some attributes in common, physical and digital products do have unique ones, such as *Track Inventory* for physical product or *User Agreement* for digital one.
