## Get started as user
### Logging on to the Commerce Manager

* You can open Commerce Manager in any of the support browsers. Ask you administrator for a URL
* Enter your user name and password
* Click Login

Permissions determine which activities and functionality the user can access and what data blocks will be visible on the dashboard.
